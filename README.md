# FailuresByQuarter
Analyze the rate and distribution of failures in quarter grades

This project is intended to replace an enormous Excel workbook.
Right now, all it does is read in tabs from the workbook and do some simple subsetting of the data.
Eventually, the plan is to have it replicate all the functions of the workbook, and also add additional functionality for longitudinal comparison.
